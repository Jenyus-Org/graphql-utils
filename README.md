`graphql-utils` is a set of NPM packages which can be useful when designing high-performance GraphQL APIs in Javascript or Typescript.

It currently consists of two packages:

 - [`graphql-utils`](./graphql-utils/README.md): GraphQL utility functions compatible with any implementation of GraphQL that uses the [`graphql`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) library as a base.
 - [`nestjs-graphql-utils`](./nestjs-graphql-utils/README.md): Utilities wrapped in NestJS `ParamDecorator` to encourage the stateless nature of NestJS GraphQL resolvers.

## Installation

The packages can be installed via the `npm` and Yarn package managers. It's as easy as running `npm i @jenyus-org/<package-name>` or `yarn add @jenyus-org/<package-name>`.

For more information see the individual package folders and their respective READMEs.
