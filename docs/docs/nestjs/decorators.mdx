Overview of the decorators provided by the `@jenyus-org/nestjs-graphql-utils` package.

## `@FieldMap(deep: boolean = true, parent: string | string[] = []): FieldMap`

**New in v1.4.0**

This decorator wraps the `resolveFieldMap` utility from `graphql-utils` including the direct passing of arguments fed to the decorator. It returns a raw `FieldMap` instance which takes on the form of nested objects, where the keys represent the selected fields from the `GraphQLResolveInfo`. Keys with no sub-selections are assigned an empty object as their value.

<Sandbox
  func={(info) => resolveFieldMap(info)}
  graphql={`
  {
    posts {
      id
      title
      body
      author {
        id
        username
        firstName
        lastName
      }
      comments {
        id
        body
        author {
          id
          username
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
    }
  }
  `}
  code={`
  @Query(() => [PostObject])
  async posts(
    @FieldMap() fieldMap: FieldMap,
  ) {
    console.log(fieldMap);
  }
  `}
/>

## `@FieldNodeAt(path: string | string[]): FieldNode | undefined`

**New in v1.5.0**

`@FieldNodeAt` wraps the `getFieldNode()` utility from `graphql-utils`, which takes a path and then tries to find a field node at the specified location in the `GraphQLResolveInfo`. If none was found, `undefined` is returned instead.

## `@Fields(deep: boolean = true, parent: string | string[] = []): string[]`

**New in v1.4.0**

`@Fields` is a wrapper over the `resolveFields` utility from `graphql-utils`, which itself is a light wrapper of the `resolveFieldMaps` utility that remaps the `FieldMap` return by the function with `fieldMapToDot`.

Instead of returning a `FieldMap` result, it returns a `string[]` which are a list of all the requested fields in dot notation.

<Sandbox
  func={(info) => resolveFields(info)}
  graphql={`
  {
    posts {
      id
      title
      body
      author {
        id
        username
        firstName
        lastName
      }
      comments {
        id
        body
        author {
          id
          username
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
    }
  }
  `}
  code={`
  @Query(() => [PostObject])
  async posts(
    @Fields() fields: string[],
  ) {
    console.log(fields);
  }
  `}
/>

## `@HasFields(...fields: (string | string[])[]): boolean`

`@HasFields()` uses the received `GraphQLResolveInfo` from the incoming request, to run [`hasFields`](../reference/utilities.mdx#hasfieldsinfo-graphqlresolveinfo-search-string--string-atroot-boolean--false-boolean) for every argument passed. Just like `hasFields` it supports array syntax and dot notation, and uses AND bitwise operations ensuring that every field passed resolves to `true`.

<Sandbox
  func={(info) => hasFields(info, "posts.id")}
  graphql={`
  {
    posts {
      id
      title
      body
      author {
        id
        username
        firstName
        lastName
      }
      comments {
        id
        body
      }
    }
  }
  `}
  code={`
  @Query(() => [PostObject])
  async posts(
    @HasFields("posts.id") wantsId: boolean,
  ) {
    console.log(wantsId);
  }
  `}
/>

## `@Selections(fieldSelections: string | string[] | FieldSelections[], fields?: string[], asParent: boolean = true): string[]`

**Updated in v1.6.0**

Similar to `@HasFields()`, `@Selections` acts as a layer on top of [`resolveSelections`](../reference/utilities.mdx#resolveselectionsfields-string--fieldselections-info-graphqlresolveinfo-string), and additionally contains some logic to solve the most common use-case.

`fieldSelections` can be the same type of argument as accepted by `resolveSelections`, and will return an array of selectors which were found in the query.

Additionally, instead of passing the field selection array, users may pass a simple string, acting as the root object for subsequent fields. In this case the second argument, `fields` is required, and must be an array of strings to search within the parent selector.

<Sandbox
  func={(info) => {
    const fields = [
      {
        field: "posts",
        selections: ["author", "comments"],
      },
    ];
    return resolveSelections(fields, info);
  }}
  graphql={`
  {
    posts {
      id
      title
      body
      author {
        id
        username
        firstName
        lastName
      }
      comments {
        id
        body
      }
    }
  }
  `}
  code={`
  @Query(() => [PostObject])
  async posts(
    @Selections("posts", ["author", "comments"]) fieldSelections: string[]
  ) {
    console.log(fieldSelections);
  }
  `}
/>

A final argument that may be specified, `withParent`, allows `@Selections()` to automatically remap the fields specified in the second argument and prepend them with the parent. This can be useful to do more fine-grained checks, especially when searching for subselection of relationships like so:

<Sandbox
  func={(info) => {
    return resolveSelections(["posts.comments"], info);
  }}
  graphql={`
  {
    posts {
      id
      title
      body
      comments {
        id
        body
      }
    }
  }
  `}
  code={`
  @Query(() => [PostObject])
  async posts(
    @Selections("posts", ["comments"], true) fieldSelections: string[]
  ) {
    console.log(fieldSelections);
  }
  `}
/>
