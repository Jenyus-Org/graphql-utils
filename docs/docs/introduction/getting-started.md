GraphQL-Utils is a lightweight library built to work with the GraphQL AST to supercharge your GraphQL APIs. Unlike other offerings out there, we don't just parse the AST to an object map, or array of strings, but offer utilities to make working with the AST even easier than ever before.

## Installation

GraphQL-Utils can be installed with `npm`:

```bash
$ npm i @jenyus-org/graphql-utils --save
```

Or `yarn`:

```bash
$ yarn add @jenyus-org/graphql-utils
```

## Typescript Support

GraphQL-Utils is built with Typescript and exports declaration files so you will get stellar type-hinting including some types built into GraphQL-Utils.
